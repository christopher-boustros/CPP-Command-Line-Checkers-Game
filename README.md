A Checkers game written in C++ that runs in a command-line interface. This was one of my first programming projects, which I originally made and shared in 2014 as open-source software.

### How to run the game

To run the game locally, you need to compile the Checkers.cpp file with a C++ compiler, such as gcc. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the contents of Checkers.cpp into an online compiler, such as http://cpp.sh/.
